# Apple Plant Disease Image Computer Vision Recognition

This is a project showcasing capabilities in Convolutional Neural Network and model deployment.

### Libraries
Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Tensorflow, Scikit-Learn, Streamlit.

### Introduction
In order to increase productivity of agriculture field, automation of plant disease recognition is important to quickly find and treat plant disease. common, manual method of locating plant disease in the field is unreliable and time consuming. most of plant disease known to hit agricultural plant can be seen from its leaf and can result in major economic loss. Kashmir is a well known for its apple production in India and for this computer vision modeling we will be using image samples taken from the Kashmir apple plantations.
